# Favourite Haiku by Bruce Ross
Even the clouds / take their children to play / at autumn equinox
Picking apples / more and more light / into emptiness
Walking through the vineyards / the wind / turns into a hare
Writing table / I watch a spoon / gather the dawn
Fallen magnolia petals / the little girl makes / a new flower
Full moon / the baby turns / under her hand
One tiny feather / all the colours of the bird / weightless on my palm
Twilight / a tui mimics / a tui

# Favourite Haiku by Gary Hotham
The circus tent / all folded up / October mist...
Empty room / one swinging coat hanger / measures the silence
Beyond / stars beyond / star
Holding the water / held by it / the dark mud
Hair, in my comb's teeth / the color of autumn wind / this whole day is gray.
A grasshopper / jumped into it / summer dusk
Muttering thunder / the bottom of the river / scattered with clams
Lonely night / the elephant / tugs at his chain.
The old barber / sweeping hair / into the giant bag
In the hotel lobby / the bare bulb of a floor lamp / shines down on its distant base
Trickling / over the dam / summer's end
Lone red-winged blackbird / riding a reed in high tide / billowing clouds.
crickets... / then / thunder
Breathing... / the teacup / filled with shadow
Beyond the porch / the summer night...leaning out / a moment
Fallen birch leaf / vein-side / to the sky

# Favourite Haiku by Angela Terry
Write me down / as one who loved poetry / and persimmons
Brush fire... / we would rescue / different things
Virginia rail the voice of the mud itself
Starry night... / what's left of my life / is enough
My thumbprint / on this thousand-year-old pot / fits hers
Foghorns / we lower a kayak / into the sound
Autumn fog... / the river knows / the way
A warm fall day / learning from the rock / to do nothing
Winter morning / without leaf or flower / the shape of the tree
Tranquillity / walking alone / happy alone

# Favourite Haiku by Susan Constable
Under the rainbow / a hundred cows with / one expression
How to dress her / for eternity blossom rain
Dark comes early now / we speak of the children / we didn't have
Dark dark night / a leaf strikes the pavement / stem first
First light / everything in this room / was already here
Summer night / we turn out all the lights / to hear the rain
Spring breeze / I catch the tune / she leaves behind
On a bare twig rain beads what light there is

# Favourite Haiku by Scott Mason
Woodland path / a small flower / bends our knees
Midsummer stream / a grackle dips its beak / in shimmer
Along the roadside / Dixie cups / of summer wind...
Under the rainbow / a hundred cows with / one expression
Receding tide the gasps of little shells
Sunrise / among the silent earth movers / a fawn
Mountain torrent / the water ouzel flicks / a white eyelid
Heat lightning / christmas beetles / spangle the fly screen
Shanty town / the jagged edges / of moonlight
Winter landscape / one more raven flaps out / of her paintbrush
The day begins / descendants of dinosaurs / darting, singing
Dead hamster / my son invents / a religion
No way out / Death's at the door / demanding candy
Far upriver / the villages / with nothing to sell
Circle of lamplight / I complete the baby quilt / begun for me
Swallowtail / maybe I'll / say yes
Cold moon / a moment of hesitation / years ago
Morning fog... / when my embryo / had gills
The vermillion glow / from the pistachio trees / I knew your father

# Favourite Haiku by Stephen Addiss
Summer heat / the strands of hair not captured / by her braid
Winter gusts / through the cedars / sharpen the rocks
Lilies / a Catholic girl / engorged with doubt
The tufts of weeds go / where the wind / wants to go
The river / the river makes / of the moon
Falling into / the darkness of an old well / a camellia
More rain... / the stream makes room / for each new drop
Men and women / and their shadows / dancing
Fourteen donkeys / in a field / fourteen donkeys!
Singing as they go / insects float down the stream / on a broken bough

# Favourite Haiku by Alan Summers
Crowded carriage / the breeze around / a lone ragwort
Death Row cleaners / the waiting palm prints / on the visitor partitions
Leaving his place / the heels of man-socks / around my ankles
The cat's teeth / dribble oriole blood / spring equinox
Beneath continents / of slow moving algae / my alcoholic father
Pregnant daughter / a muscle of minnows / changing the current
A bee gathers the faerie deep in the flower
Herring gulls their houses on our houses
Snow out of season / softer than the blackcap's song / drifting on the Downs
Over the still sea / a sudden cluster of clouds / just the sighs of whales
Ol' lonesome freight train / low call of the tawny owl / rolls over the roofs
Dry lightning / sizzling in twilight / the baby kicks
Mouse-scuttle / across the roof shingles / sunset
Amniotic sac / the floating nests / of prairie doves
Shore / and shadow / of shore
Passing storm / my dog steps / on the moon
Unspooling / a fishing fly loosed / at riverine shadows
A skein of ashes / mother and son / turning home
Early spring... / the mosquito / with a broken beat
Dandelion fluff... / another search / for a self
Autumn dusk... / one by one / the stars / unlock

# Favourite Haiku by Ron Moss
The sea darkens / the voice of the duck / faintly white
The thief left it behind / the moon / at my window
The sea darkens / the voice of the duck / faintly white
Fog / sitting here / without the mountains
Foghorns / we lower a kayak / into the sound
The visible pulse / of a baby's soft spot / wren answering wren
Summer night / we turn out all the lights / to hear the rain
The sack of kittens / sinking in the icy creek / increases the cold
Sound of mountain / sound of ocean / everywhere spring rain
All beings are flowers / blooming in a flowing universe

# Favourite Haiku by Karen Cesar
A useless novelty / each of us already has / a chattering skull
Sunlit jar / the beekeeper's gift / on the doorstep

# Favourite Haiku by Patrick Sweeney
How lonely / to have grown scallions / in the world of dreams
After devouring whale meat / sensei and the orphans / play baseball
Going deeper / still deeper / only (more) blue mountains

# Favourite Haiku by Carlos Col√≥n
Blackbirds / lifting / the field
After confession / skipping / home
During our little talk / I tear a daisy / to shreds
Late August / I bring him the garden / in my skirt
The snow is melting / and the village is flooded / with children
Hose left on / the low spot in the yard / filling with sparrows
Valentine's Day / a cyclist signals / with a long-stem rose
Climb Mount Fuji / O snail / but slowly, slowly
The man pulling radishes / pointed my way / with a radish
The hills / release the summer clouds / one by one by one
In the falling snow / a laughing boy holds out his palms / until they are white

# Favourite Haiku by Ken Jones
Pushing my reflection / this wheelbarrow / full of rain
How lonely it is / cultivating the stone leeks / in this world of dreams
Those in line / watching the wind / sweep the earth
On a journey through life / tilling a small field / back and forth

# Favourite haiku by Cherie Hunter Day
Crow perched / on a withered branch / autumn evening
Don't kill the fly! / he wrings his hands / he wrings his feet
Autumn cicada / dies by the side / of its empty shell
Warm rain before dawn / my milk flows into her / unseen

# Favourite Haiku by Tom Painting
The old field / throbbing with insects / the summer moon
New year's rain / the circles in the puddle / widen
Winter stillness / the sound / of branches breaking
Valentine's card / from an old lover / icicles drip from the eave
Sunflowers / one facing / the other way
A bare bulb / burning in the barn / winter fields
Headstone / a dash / between the years
In the woodpile / the broken / axe handle
Dog shit / or me / the fly doesn't care

# Favourite Haiku by Elizabeth Smither
How much I desire / inside my little satchel / the moon and flowers
Spider / do not worry / I keep house casually

# Favourite Haiku by Ellen Grace Olinger
Sundown / the river melts / into the woods
Frozen branches / measure the emptiness / winter sunset
Against the horizon / grain elevators / number the towns
Wild pond / the heron begins / his evening flight

# Favourite Haiku by Ferris Gilli
Children's laughter / a weekend father / with sticks in his hair
Low tide / gull and gannet shadows / pick shells
The softness / of lamb ears / garden for the blind
New coolness / the old dog stays / closer to home
Magpie season / the schoolgirl's lunchbox / on her head
Temple steps / a man with a snake / offers to tell my future
Early morning / the rain falls lightly / on water-jar lids
Shades of autumn / the gleaners come / in rat-grey coats
Sun-touched gully / the wool and bones / of a passing winter
Sprigs of mint / in a blue mason jar / twilight breeze
